## NixOS/Home-Manager config, flake-enabled

I'm getting on board the Nix(OS) hype train. I've been having a tough time figuring things
out, but I'll get there. I have a ~250 commit private dotfile repo that I'm porting to Nix
bit by bit. I'm particularly looking forward to secrets management through tools like
nix-sops or agenix, and being able to reuse all this declarative config goodness on my
work-stipulated macbook.
